## Project arhitecture -> FOLDER-by-FEATURE 
# Every folder under the lib directory is a feature in the application 

#Example: 

    To add a settings feature to our app, the folder structure would be as follows: 
    >lib
        >settings
            settings_screen.dart
            settings_controllers
            settings_data

    Note: Everything that is affiliated with a specific feature is stored inside the "feature" folder that is being used. 
    For this example it is "settings" feature folder.
